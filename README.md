# 🧹 Data Cleaning Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **cleaning and preprocessing a messy dataset** to make it suitable for **data analysis and machine learning tasks**.  
Raw datasets often contain missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and errors that can negatively impact insights and model performance.  
The goal of this project is to transform raw data into a **clean, reliable, and analysis-ready dataset**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify and handle missing values  
- Remove duplicate and irrelevant records  
- Fix inconsistent and incorrect data formats  
- Convert data types to appropriate formats  
- Detect and handle outliers  
- Prepare clean data for further analysis or ML modeling  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔍 Data Cleaning Steps Performed
1. **Data Inspection**
   - Checked dataset shape, columns, and data types
   - Identified missing and inconsistent values

2. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Removed or filled missing values using appropriate techniques

3. **Removing Duplicates**
   - Identified and removed duplicate rows

4. **Data Type Correction**
   - Converted columns to correct data types (numeric, categorical, datetime)

5. **Handling Outliers**
   - Detected unusual values and treated them accordingly

6. **Final Validation**
   - Ensured the dataset is clean and ready for analysis or machine learning

---

## 📊 Outcome
- Clean and structured dataset  
- Improved data quality and consistency  
- Dataset ready for:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature Engineering
  - Machine Learning Models
